# House Price Prediction

this is a the source code to my submission to the kaggle content [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)


All the code can be found in the jupyter notebook [HousePrices.ipynb](HousePrices.ipynb).


## Setup:
if you want to run the code on a local machine for some reason, you can set up the project by doing:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

it's always good practice to install libraries in a virtual environment instead of system wide:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate # linux
.\.venv/scripts/activate # windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
